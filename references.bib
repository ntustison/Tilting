	Abstract = {EMPIRE10 (Evaluation of Methods for Pulmonary Image REgistration 2010) is a public platform for fair and meaningful comparison of registration algorithms which are applied to a database of intrapatient thoracic CT image pairs. Evaluation of nonrigid registration techniques is a nontrivial task. This is compounded by the fact that researchers typically test only on their own data, which varies widely. For this reason, reliable assessment and comparison of different registration algorithms has been virtually impossible in the past. In this work we present the results of the launch phase of EMPIRE10, which comprised the comprehensive evaluation and comparison of 20 individual algorithms from leading academic and industrial research groups. All algorithms are applied to the same set of 30 thoracic CT pairs. Algorithm settings and parameters are chosen by researchers expert in the configuration of their own method and the evaluation is independent, using the same criteria for all participants. All results are published on the EMPIRE10 website (http://empire10.isi.uu.nl). The challenge remains ongoing and open to new participants. Full results from 24 algorithms have been published at the time of writing. This paper details the organization of the challenge, the data and evaluation methods and the outcome of the initial launch with 20 algorithms. The gain in knowledge and future work are discussed.},

@article{avants2011,
	Abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant
	support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment
	reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report
	and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging
	Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open
	source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image
	registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative
	morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for
	the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and
	deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We
	detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared
	intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise
	mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare
	their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted
	MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report
	evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the
	affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate
	that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction
	results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual
	information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic
	mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022).
	Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify
	the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our
	open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark
	parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study
	to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible
	evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal
	template construction and brain labeling.},

@article{clarkson2011,
	Abstract = {Cortical thickness estimation performed in-vivo via magnetic resonance
	imaging is an important technique for the diagnosis and understanding
	of the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, two
	different computational paradigms exist, with methods generally classified
	as either surface or voxel-based. This paper provides a much needed
	comparison of the surface-based method FreeSurfer and two voxel-based
	methods using clinical data. We test the effects of computing regional
	statistics using two different atlases and demonstrate that this
	makes a significant difference to the cortical thickness results.
	We assess reproducibility, and show that FreeSurfer has a regional
	standard deviation of thickness difference on same day scans that
	is significantly lower than either a Laplacian or Registration based
	method and discuss the trade off between reproducibility and segmentation
	accuracy caused by bending energy constraints. We demonstrate that
	voxel-based methods can detect similar patterns of group-wise differences
	as well as FreeSurfer in typical applications such as producing group-wise
	maps of statistically significant thickness change, but that regional
	statistics can vary between methods. We use a Support Vector Machine
	to classify patients against controls and did not find statistically
	significantly different results with voxel based methods compared
	to FreeSurfer. Finally we assessed longitudinal performance and concluded
	that currently FreeSurfer provides the most plausible measure of
	change over time, with further work required for voxel based methods.},

@article{eskildsen2012,
	Abstract = {Brain extraction is an important step in the analysis of brain images.
	The variability in brain morphology and the difference in intensity
	characteristics due to imaging sequences make the development of
	a general purpose brain extraction algorithm challenging. To address
	this issue, we propose a new robust method (BEaST) dedicated to produce
	consistent and accurate brain extraction. This method is based on
	nonlocal segmentation embedded in a multi-resolution framework. A
	library of 80 priors is semi-automatically constructed from the NIH-sponsored
	MRI study of normal brain development, the International Consortium
	for Brain Mapping, and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
	databases. In testing, a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9834$\pm$0.0053
	was obtained when performing leave-one-out cross validation selecting
	only 20 priors from the library. Validation using the online Segmentation
	Validation Engine resulted in a top ranking position with a mean
	Dice coefficient of 0.9781$\pm$0.0047. Robustness of BEaST is demonstrated
	on all baseline ADNI data, resulting in a very low failure rate.
	The segmentation accuracy of the method is better than two widely
	used publicly available methods and recent state-of-the-art hybrid
	approaches. BEaST provides results comparable to a recent label fusion
	approach, while being 40 times faster and requiring a much smaller
	library of priors.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential
	in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of
	the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began
	building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the
	goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized
	therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis
	is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency
	of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative
	imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools
	to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free
	open-source software application for medical image computing. As
	a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation
	that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced
	functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for
	a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation,
	3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming
	platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the
	new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to
	focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions
	for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user
	interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects
	of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be
	readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed
	to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of
	3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D
	Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation
	of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate
	the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several
	use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate
	on the future directions that can further facilitate development
	and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

	Abstract = {FreeSurfer is a popular software package to measure cortical thickness
	and volume of neuroanatomical structures. However, little if any
	is known about measurement reliability across various data processing
	conditions. Using a set of 30 anatomical T1-weighted 3T MRI scans,
	we investigated the effects of data processing variables such as
	FreeSurfer version (v4.3.1, v4.5.0, and v5.0.0), workstation (Macintosh
	and Hewlett-Packard), and Macintosh operating system version (OSX
	10.5 and OSX 10.6). Significant differences were revealed between
	FreeSurfer version v5.0.0 and the two earlier versions. These differences
	were on average 8.8 $\pm$ 6.6% (range 1.3-64.0%) (volume) and 2.8
	$\pm$ 1.3% (1.1-7.7%) (cortical thickness). About a factor two smaller
	differences were detected between Macintosh and Hewlett-Packard workstations
	and between OSX 10.5 and OSX 10.6. The observed differences are similar
	in magnitude as effect sizes reported in accuracy evaluations and
	neurodegenerative studies.The main conclusion is that in the context
	of an ongoing study, users are discouraged to update to a new major
	release of either FreeSurfer or operating system or to switch to
	a different type of workstation without repeating the analysis; results
	thus give a quantitative support to successive recommendations stated
	by FreeSurfer developers over the years. Moreover, in view of the
	large and significant cross-version differences, it is concluded
	that formal assessment of the accuracy of FreeSurfer is desirable.},

@article{haegelen2013,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Template-based segmentation techniques have been developed
	to facilitate the accurate targeting of deep brain structures in
	patients with movement disorders. Three template-based brain MRI
	segmentation techniques were compared to determine the best strategy
	for segmenting the deep brain structures of patients with Parkinson's
	disease. METHODS: T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
	(MR) image templates were created by averaging MR images of 57 patients
	with Parkinson's disease. Twenty-four deep brain structures were
	manually segmented on the templates. To validate the template-based
	segmentation, 14 of the 24 deep brain structures from the templates
	were manually segmented on 10 MR scans of Parkinson's patients as
	a gold standard. We compared the manual segmentations with three
	methods of automated segmentation: two registration-based approaches,
	automatic nonlinear image matching and anatomical labeling (ANIMAL)
	and symmetric image normalization (SyN), and one patch-label fusion
	technique. The automated labels were then compared with the manual
	labels using a Dice-kappa metric and center of gravity. A Friedman
	test was used to compare the Dice-kappa values and paired t tests
	for the center of gravity. RESULTS: The Friedman test showed a significant
	difference between the three methods for both thalami (p < 0.05)
	and not for the subthalamic nuclei. Registration with ANIMAL was
	better than with SyN for the left thalamus and was better than the
	patch-based method for the right thalamus. CONCLUSION: Although template-based
	approaches are the most used techniques to segment basal ganglia
	by warping onto MR images, we found that the patch-based method provided
	similar results and was less time-consuming. Patch-based method may
	be preferable for the subthalamic nucleus segmentation in patients
	with Parkinson's disease.},

	Abstract = {Automatic whole-brain extraction from magnetic resonance images (MRI),
	also known as skull stripping, is a key component in most neuroimage
	pipelines. As the first element in the chain, its robustness is critical
	for the overall performance of the system. Many skull stripping methods
	have been proposed, but the problem is not considered to be completely
	solved yet. Many systems in the literature have good performance
	on certain datasets (mostly the datasets they were trained/tuned
	on), but fail to produce satisfactory results when the acquisition
	conditions or study populations are different. In this paper we introduce
	a robust, learning-based brain extraction system (ROBEX). The method
	combines a discriminative and a generative model to achieve the final
	result. The discriminative model is a Random Forest classifier trained
	to detect the brain boundary; the generative model is a point distribution
	model that ensures that the result is plausible. When a new image
	is presented to the system, the generative model is explored to find
	the contour with highest likelihood according to the discriminative
	model. Because the target shape is in general not perfectly represented
	by the generative model, the contour is refined using graph cuts
	to obtain the final segmentation. Both models were trained using
	92 scans from a proprietary dataset but they achieve a high degree
	of robustness on a variety of other datasets. ROBEX was compared
	with six other popular, publicly available methods (BET, BSE, FreeSurfer,
	AFNI, BridgeBurner, and GCUT) on three publicly available datasets
	(IBSR, LPBA40, and OASIS, 137 scans in total) that include a wide
	range of acquisition hardware and a highly variable population (different
	age groups, healthy/diseased). The results show that ROBEX provides
	significantly improved performance measures for almost every method/dataset
	combination.},

	Abstract = {Medical image registration is an important task in medical image
	processing. It refers to the process of aligning data sets, possibly
	from different modalities (e.g., magnetic resonance and computed

	different subjects (in case of population studies). A large number
	of methods for image registration are described in the literature.
	Unfortunately, there is not one method that works for all applications.
	We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer
	program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software
	consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to
	solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of
	elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different
	registration methods for a specific application. The command-line
	interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets,
	by means of scripting. The usage of elastix for comparing different

@article{luo2013,
	Abstract = {The goal of nonrigid image registration is to find a suitable transformation
	such that the transformed moving image becomes similar to the reference
	image. The image registration problem can also be treated as an optimization
	problem, which tries to minimize an objective energy function that
	measures the differences between two involved images. In this paper,
	we consider image matching as the process of aligning object boundaries
	in two different images. The registration energy function can be
	defined based on the total energy associated with the object boundaries.
	The optimal transformation is obtained by finding the equilibrium
	state when the total energy is minimized, which indicates the object
	boundaries find their correspondences and stop deforming. We make
	an analogy between the above processes with the dislocation system
	in physics. The object boundaries are viewed as dislocations (line
	defects) in crystal. Then the well-developed dislocation energy is
	used to derive the energy assigned to object boundaries in images.
	The newly derived registration energy function takes the global gradient
	information of the entire image into consideration, and produces
	an orientation-dependent and long-range interaction between two images
	to drive the registration process. This property of interaction endows
	the new registration framework with both fast convergence rate and
	high registration accuracy. Moreover, the new energy function can
	be adapted to realize symmetric diffeomorphic transformation so as
	to ensure one-to-one matching between subjects. In this paper, the
	superiority of the new method is theoretically proven, experimentally
	tested and compared with the state-of-the-art SyN method. Experimental
	results with 3-D magnetic resonance brain images demonstrate that
	the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in terms of
	both registration accuracy and computation time.},

	Abstract = {Surface-based brain imaging analysis offers the advantages of preserving
	the topology of cortical activation, increasing statistical power
	of group-level statistics, estimating cortical thickness, and visualizing
	with ease the pattern of activation across the whole cortex. SUMA
	is an open-source suite of programs for performing surface-based
	analysis and visualization. It was designed since its inception to
	allow for a fine control over the mapping between volume and surface
	domains, and for very fast and simultaneous display of multiple surface
	models and corresponding multitudes of datasets, all while maintaining
	a direct two-way link to volumetric data from which surface models
	and data originated. SUMA provides tools for performing spatial operations
	such as controlled smoothing, clustering, and interactive ROI drawing
	on folded surfaces in 3D, in addition to the various level-1 and
	level-2 FMRI statistics including FDR and FWE correction for multiple
	comparisons. In our contribution to this commemorative issue of Neuroimage
	we touch on the importance of surface-based analysis and provide
	a historic backdrop that motivated the creation of SUMA. We also
	highlight features that are particular to SUMA, notably the standardization
	procedure of meshes to greatly facilitate group-level analyses, and
	the ability to control SUMA's graphical interface from external programs
	making it possible to handle large collections of data with relative

	Abstract = {One key issue that must be addressed during the development of image
	segmentation algorithms is the accuracy of the results they produce.
	Algorithm developers require this so they can see where methods need
	to be improved and see how new developments compare with existing
	ones. Users of algorithms also need to understand the characteristics
	of algorithms when they select and apply them to their neuroimaging
	analysis applications. Many metrics have been proposed to characterize
	error and success rates in segmentation, and several datasets have
	also been made public for evaluation. Still, the methodologies used
	in analyzing and reporting these results vary from study to study,
	so even when studies use the same metrics their numerical results
	may not necessarily be directly comparable. To address this problem,
	we developed a web-based resource for evaluating the performance
	of skull-stripping in T1-weighted MRI. The resource provides both
	the data to be segmented and an online application that performs
	a validation study on the data. Users may download the test dataset,
	segment it using whichever method they wish to assess, and upload
	their segmentation results to the server. The server computes a series
	of metrics, displays a detailed report of the validation results,
	and archives these for future browsing and analysis. We applied this
	framework to the evaluation of 3 popular skull-stripping algorithms--the

	extraction. Hum. Brain Mapp. 17 (3),143-155 (Nov)], the Hybrid Watershed

@article{wu2013,
	Abstract = {Deformable registration has been widely used in neuroscience studies
	for spatial normalization of brain images onto the standard space.
	Because of possible large anatomical differences across different
	individual brains, registration performance could be limited when
	trying to estimate a single directed deformation pathway, i.e., either
	from template to subject or from subject to template. Symmetric image
	registration, however, offers an effective way to simultaneously
	deform template and subject images toward each other until they meet
	at the middle point. Although some intensity-based registration algorithms
	have nicely incorporated this concept of symmetric deformation, the
	pointwise intensity matching between two images may not necessarily
	imply the matching of correct anatomical correspondences. Based on
	HAMMER registration algorithm (Shen and Davatzikos, [2002]: IEEE
	Trans Med Imaging 21:1421-1439), we integrate the strategies of hierarchical
	attribute matching and symmetric diffeomorphic deformation to build
	a new symmetric-diffeomorphic HAMMER registration algorithm, called
	as S-HAMMER. The performance of S-HAMMER has been extensively compared
	with 14 state-of-the-art nonrigid registration algorithms evaluated
	in (Klein et al., [2009]: NeuroImage 46:786-802) by using real brain
	images in LPBA40, IBSR18, CUMC12, and MGH10 datasets. In addition,
	the registration performance of S-HAMMER, by comparison with other
	methods, is also demonstrated on both elderly MR brain images (>70
	years old) and the simulated brain images with ground-truth deformation
	fields. In all experiments, our proposed method achieves the best
	registration performance over all other registration methods, indicating
	the high applicability of our method in future neuroscience and clinical
	applications. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

	Abstract = {Measurement of brain change due to neurodegenerative disease and
	treatment is one of the fundamental tasks of neuroimaging. Deformation-based
	morphometry (DBM) has been long recognized as an effective and sensitive
	tool for estimating the change in the volume of brain regions over
	time. This paper demonstrates that a straightforward application
	of DBM to estimate the change in the volume of the hippocampus can
	result in substantial bias, i.e., an overestimation of the rate of
	change in hippocampal volume. In ADNI data, this bias is manifested
	as a non-zero intercept of the regression line fitted to the 6 and
	12 month rates of hippocampal atrophy. The bias is further confirmed
	by applying DBM to repeat scans of subjects acquired on the same
	day. This bias appears to be the result of asymmetry in the interpolation
	of baseline and followup images during longitudinal image registration.
	Correcting this asymmetry leads to bias-free atrophy estimation.},
